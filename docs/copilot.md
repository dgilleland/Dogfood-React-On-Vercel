GitHub Copilot: Enable GPT-5 mini for all clients
[object Object]

dgilleland: @agent Enable: "Enable GPT-5 mini for all clients"

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a short, actionable todo list for adding GitHub SSO and mark the planning step in-progress so we have a clear plan to follow. After that I'll provide a step-by-step implementation guide, code snippets, env var names, and testing instructions.

I'll now write the todo list. 

Created 9 todos

I'll mark the planning todo as completed in the workspace todo list so we can track progress. Then I'll provide a step-by-step implementation guide and sample code. 

Completed (1/9) *Plan and outline GitHub SSO*

I'll outline what's needed, then give a concrete, low-risk implementation path you can follow in this Next.js app (with code, env names, and testing notes).

## Summary of approach
For a Next.js app hosted on Vercel the simplest robust option is NextAuth.js (now called next-auth) with GitHub as an OAuth provider. It handles sessions, secure cookies, CSRF, and provider callbacks out of the box. Optionally add a database adapter (Prisma + Postgres) if you want persistent user accounts and sessions.

High-level steps:
- Register an OAuth application on GitHub (get Client ID + Secret).
- Install NextAuth and optional DB adapter.
- Add environment variables (GITHUB_ID, GITHUB_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET).
- Create the NextAuth API route `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`.
- Add UI hooks (sign-in, sign-out, session checking).
- (Optional) Add org/member restriction logic.
- Test locally and on Vercel.

I'll break this into a small contract and edge cases, then give concrete code and commands.

## Contract (inputs / outputs / success)
- Inputs: GitHub OAuth Client ID & Secret; NEXTAUTH_URL (app URL), NEXTAUTH_SECRET (random), optional DB URL.
- Outputs: User sign-in via GitHub; server issues secure session cookie; session accessible in pages via getServerSideProps / useSession.
- Success criteria: A user can sign in with GitHub and the app shows their name/email; sessions persist between requests.

## Edge cases & considerations
- Local development callback URLs need to match GitHub app — use http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github (or use ngrok for https).
- If you need only members of a GitHub org, implement a callback that checks GitHub membership using the token and rejects non-members.
- If you want persistent user records, add a database + adapter (Prisma + Postgres). Without DB, NextAuth stores sessions in cookies (JWT) or ephemeral memory.
- Securely store secrets: use Vercel Environment Variables for production.
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET should be a secure random string; rotate occasionally.
- Rate limits on GitHub API if you check org membership on each sign-in — cache results or store membership boolean in DB.
- If you need SSO for an organization with enforced SAML/SCIM or enterprise SSO, you'd integrate at GitHub Enterprise level; otherwise standard OAuth will work for public GitHub accounts.

## Concrete implementation (NextAuth + GitHub)
Below are the tangible files/changes you would add.

1) Install dependencies
- Recommended: NextAuth v4 and optional adapter (Prisma) if you want DB.
- Commands (PowerShell):
  - npm install next-auth
  - If using Prisma/Postgres: npm install @prisma/client prisma and optionally next-auth/prisma-adapter (and set up prisma schema)

2) Add env vars (local)
- Create `.env.local` in project root (NOT committed). Put:
  - GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
  - GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
  - NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
  - NEXTAUTH_SECRET=some-long-random-string (use openssl/random)

On Vercel, set the same vars in Project Settings -> Environment Variables. Use production NEXTAUTH_URL e.g. https://your-site.vercel.app

3) API route: `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`
Create this file and register GitHub provider. Minimal example:

- Uses NextAuth with GitHub provider
- Example includes a callback to add organization check (commented optional)

Key parts:
- `providers: [ GithubProvider({ clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID, clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET, }) ]`
- `callbacks.session` to attach user info to session
- `callbacks.signIn` to check org membership (optional)

4) Add UI usage
- Use `import { SessionProvider, signIn, signOut, useSession } from "next-auth/react"` in `_app.js` or pages.
- Add a Sign in with GitHub button that calls `signIn('github')`.
- Display session data with `useSession`.

5) Optional DB with Prisma
- Create `prisma/schema.prisma` and configure provider (postgresql).
- Use `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` and pass adapter to NextAuth config.
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create tables.

6) Testing
- Locally: run `npm run dev`, sign in with GitHub, accept OAuth, verify session.
- If callback URL mismatch, GitHub will reject — adjust the app settings.
- On Vercel: set production env vars and deploy.

## Example code snippets
I'll outline minimal code you can paste into your project.

A) Add NextAuth route: create `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` with contents like:

(I'm not opening or editing files yet — tell me if you want me to add this to your repo. If yes, I will modify/create the file and run quick checks.)

B) Add providers and optional org restriction:
- In the signIn callback, fetch `https://api.github.com/user/memberships/orgs/<ORG>` or use `GET /orgs/:org/members/:username` with the user access token to confirm membership. If not a member, return false to reject sign in.

C) Add UI in `_app.js`:
- Wrap app with `SessionProvider` from `next-auth/react`.

## Security and production notes
- Use `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` env var; don't reuse client secret.
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Limit scopes requested from GitHub (default is read:user and user:email). For org checks, you might need read:org scope.
- If you use a DB, protect migrations and backups; encrypt DB credentials in production.
- If onboarding enterprise SSO (SAML) for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, that’s different—requires org admin setup.

## Next steps / offer
I can:
- Add a working NextAuth integration to this repository (create `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`, update `_app.js`, add a Sign in button on index.js), plus a `.env.local.example` and README steps — and run local dev checks.
- Or show precise code snippets for copying into your app and a checklist to follow manually.

Which would you prefer? If you want me to implement it now, confirm and I’ll:
- Update the todo list (mark install/config steps in-progress).
- Create the NextAuth API route and UI changes.
- Run quick local verification (npm install and start dev) and report results.

dgilleland: Please implement a working NextAuth integration.

GitHub Copilot: I'm going to mark the "Install dependencies" todo as in-progress, then read the current `_app.js` and `index.js` to wire NextAuth SessionProvider and add sign-in/out UI before creating the NextAuth API route. Expected outcome: I'll have the repo files needed to integrate NextAuth prepared for creation. 

Starting (3/9) *Install dependencies*

I'll read `_app.js`, `index.js`, and hello.js so I can see how to integrate SessionProvider and where to add sign-in/out UI. I'll fetch those three files. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/GH/dgilleland/Dogfood-React-On-Vercel/pages/_app.js)

Read [](file:///c%3A/GH/dgilleland/Dogfood-React-On-Vercel/pages/index.js)

Read [](file:///c%3A/GH/dgilleland/Dogfood-React-On-Vercel/pages/api/hello.js)

Progress update: I read _app.js, index.js, and hello.js to see where to wire NextAuth. Next I'll add dependencies and create new files: install next-auth, create `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`, update _app.js to wrap `SessionProvider`, and add sign-in/out UI to index.js. I'll run npm install and run the dev server to sanity-check. I'll now run the install command. 

Ran terminal command: npm install next-auth

Now I'll create the NextAuth API route and update _app.js and index.js. These are file edits; I'll use the apply_patch tool to add `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`, update _app.js to import `SessionProvider` and update index.js to show sign-in/out buttons and display session info.

```
Progress update: I added NextAuth, created the API route, wrapped the app with SessionProvider, and added sign-in/out UI. Next I'll run a quick dev start to ensure there are no runtime errors. Then I'll update the todo list marking install and route implementation completed. 

Ran terminal command: npm run dev --silent

Made changes.
